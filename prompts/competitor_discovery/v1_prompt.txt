# Task

Identify the key competitors in Denmark that directly compete with the products/services in this campaign. For EACH competitor you find, research and provide:

1. **name** — The official company name as used in Denmark.
2. **aliases** — Other names, brands, or sub-brands customers commonly use (e.g., "SEAS-NVE" for Andel Energi, "OK El" for VestEnergi). Include common misspellings if relevant.
3. **rationale** — One sentence: why this company competes with our campaign.
4. **discovered_urls** — Real URLs you found during your search. Prioritize:
   - Official pricing/product page
   - Trustpilot page (`dk.trustpilot.com/review/...`)
   - Recent news articles, especially involving Forbrugerombudsmanden, prisstigninger, or scandals
   - Comparison/review sites relevant to this market
5. **focus_areas** — What is specifically relevant to compare against OUR campaign. Be concrete based on what you actually found:
   - Price differences, binding terms, hidden fees
   - Known service issues or recent controversies
   - Specific product features where they differ from us

# Guidelines
- Focus on competitors that a customer on the phone might mention or currently be using.
- Include both large national players and relevant regional/budget alternatives.
- Do NOT include companies that only operate in a tangentially related market.
- Aim for 5-15 competitors depending on market size.
- Every URL in `discovered_urls` must be a real URL you found — do not fabricate URLs.

# Output Format
Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No commentary, no markdown, just JSON.
