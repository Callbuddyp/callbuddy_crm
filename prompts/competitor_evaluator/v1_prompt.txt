# Evaluation Checklist

Review each competitor against these criteria. Use web search to verify claims and fill gaps.

## 1. Comparison Summary Completeness
- Does it cover ALL relevant pricing dimensions for this market? (Not just headline price — check for subscription fees, per-unit costs, setup fees, binding, cancellation terms, included extras, discounts)
- Are the comparisons to our offering accurate? Cross-check against the Campaign Information above.
- If any pricing dimension is missing, search for it and add it.

## 2. Strengths Quality
- Are these genuine strengths a customer would actually value?
- Remove generic filler like "god kundeservice" unless backed by evidence.
- Add any notable strengths the researcher missed.

## 3. Angles Actionability
- Does each angle reference specific numbers from BOTH our offering and the competitor's?
- Could a salesperson naturally say this during a phone call?
- Remove angles that are too vague or don't help close a deal.
- Sharpen weak angles with concrete numbers.

## 4. Switching Barriers
- Are contractual barriers accurate? (Check binding periods, cancellation terms)
- Are psychological barriers realistic for this market?
- Add any barriers the researcher missed.

## 5. Anecdotes Quality
- Is each anecdote specific enough to use in conversation? (Has a situation, timeframe, outcome)
- Remove anything that reads as generic ("dårlig service", "lange ventetider" without details)
- If anecdotes are weak, search Trustpilot / forums for better ones.

## 6. Recent News
- Are dates and facts accurate?
- Search for any recent events the researcher missed (price changes, regulatory actions, press)
- Remove items older than 12 months.

## 7. Missing Competitors
- Are there major competitors in this market that the researcher missed entirely?
- If so, research and add them with the full field set.

## 8. Irrelevant Competitors
- Remove any competitors that a customer would realistically never mention.

# Output

Return the corrected and improved JSON array. Every competitor must be a FLAT object with exactly these 9 keys: name, competitor_id, aliases, comparison_summary, strengths, angles, switching_barriers, anecdotes, recent_news.

CRITICAL: Every value must be either a string or an array of strings. Do NOT use nested objects. The comparison_summary must be a single string. The switching_barriers must be a flat array. Maintain the same language as the input.

Return ONLY the JSON array. No commentary, no markdown code fences, just JSON.
